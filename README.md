This is part of a tutorial on prism with WPF in which the program should return jokes (facts) about Chuck Norris

### idea
the app is simple, that is, the user sets up how many facts it should return, and when clicking on the gather button, the listbox will be populated with information.


whilst clicking on a fact from the listbox, the details is populated with the full joke, as it is with a link to the original api url website.
